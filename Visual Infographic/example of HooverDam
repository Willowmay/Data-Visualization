"Truth and Lies" in Visualization Infographic 

The dataset (Hoover Dam Data.xlsx) shows two measures of water level in Lake Mead, 
beginning in 1935, when the Hoover Dam was first created and Lake Mead began to fill up till recently, 
and the timestamp of when the data were collected.   

It also shows various baseline levels, such as the drought level and the overflow level.  

I used Tableau to build truth and lies in this visualization infographic
