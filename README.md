# Data-Visualization


Simplify complex data and analytics, and improve comprehension, communication, and decision-making


These are several things I got from Data Visualization:

Conceptual and scientific foundations from perception and cognition - design, perception, cognition, decision-making, 
data structures and appropriate data representations, and ethics.

Exploring the span of technologies in visualization - all the ways in which different data types are mapped onto 
different geometries, to broaden the range of approaches the students are exposed to.

Working with real data with real tools, using and re-using datasets to gain experience in applying 
key visualization principles and practices.

Using visualization for real-world problems. In real-world applications, visualization is used to support communication, 
decision-making and problem-solving.
